It is a Unity fund test project.

It is a Unity fund test project.
You CANNOT interact! Only watch and chill about the fragile existence of life :)

This program
- populates an hd 1920*1080 screensize with stars, then changes position/scale of each one by one
- the spawning loop iterations are timed by a coroutine
- flying and rotating donuts fly through the screen. They are controlled via some fixed routings.
- the donut spawner is a singleton script. If a donut leaves the screen, calls the proper method to unleash the next donut
- version: Unity 2021.3.45f, C#
- watch it on: https://csonttorony.itch.io/starsanddonuts
